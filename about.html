         <h2>About the Author!</h2>
         <p>I, Brendan Garrow, am a student at Michigan State University pursueing a bachelor's in Games and Interactive Media. As part of the program, I am taking a web design and development class: MI349. As someone who has worked with some bare bones web development, I thought it would be interesting to see how the professional workflow is and adapt my self-taught style to approach industry standard. This blog itself is a product of my work in this class, as well as my 'newly' refurbished portfolio website, which will be released 'soon'.</p>
         <p>Some of my hobbies include: </p>
         <ul>
            <li>Programming of all kinds</li>
            <li>Building and repairing computers</li>
            <li>Playing video games</li>
            <li>Listening to all kinds of music</li>
            <li>Gamejams (this is different than programming trust me)</li>
         </ul>
         <p>The namesake of this blog has a fun origin: I was raised in Texas, from ages four to sixteen; for all intents and purposes I am a Texan, despite what my Michigan-born mother may have to say. Right before finishing high school I moved back to Michigan, where my new friends gave me the nickname "Texas", and it just kinda stuck. With Texas as a pseudonym, I decided to name my afformentioned portfolio website to include it. I wanted a fun domain name so I sat on ICANN's whois site for half an hour trying to find one that was available. I ended up finding <a href="https://texascod.in">TexasCod.in</a> -- and for a good deal too -- which I fell in love with, buying it up that night. When I needed to come up with a blog name, I took my portfolio's name and rebranded it to fit the new purpose.</p>
